## Key Insights

### 1. Government/Research = Biggest Opportunity
- THL alone does 64,000-respondent surveys
- Statistics Finland does dozens of phone surveys per year
- Government budget = can afford €5,999 easily
- Established procurement processes

### 2. We Were Missing Major CATI Players
- InVeritas explicitly offers CATI in Finland
- Statistics Finland uses CATI methodology extensively
- Finnish Institute of Occupational Health has massive ongoing surveys
- University of Helsinki just launched new survey infrastructure

### 3. Consulting Firms = Volume Through Clients
- Futurelab, Digitalist, EY do surveys for their clients
- They might white-label our service
- One consulting firm partnership = access to many end clients

### 4. Surveypal = Interesting Case
- Finnish company (Tampere/Helsinki)
- Competitor in CX feedback space
- BUT: They don't do voice surveys yet
- Could be acquisition target OR they acquire us

### 5. Swedish Market Still Valid But Smaller
- Keep Swedish orgs on list
- But prioritize large Finnish government/research orgs first
- €5,999 survey is easier sell to government with €500K budgets

---

## Bottom Line

**Original list was GOOD but incomplete.**

We were targeting the right TYPE of organizations (government, research, market research), but we missed:
- The BIGGEST players (THL 64K survey!)
- Explicit CATI providers (InVeritas)
- National agencies (Statistics Finland)
- Consulting firms that do surveys for clients

**Recommendation:**
1. Add 15 new organizations (listed above)
2. Prioritize government/research (Tier 1) first
3. Keep Swedish orgs but as lower priority
4. Consider consulting firms for partnership/white-label deals

**Expected outcome:**
- Original strategy: 30 orgs → 4-6 responses → 2-4 calls → 1-2 customers
- Updated strategy: 45 orgs → 8-12 responses → 4-8 calls → 2-4 customers
- Government/research orgs have BIGGER budgets and MORE surveys → higher LTV

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Research complete
2. **TODO:** Update PROSPECTS.csv with 15 new organizations
3. **TODO:** Get contact emails for new orgs
4. **TODO:** Customize email templates for different tiers
5. **TODO:** Add cc: maximilian.rehn@gmail.com to all outreach emails
