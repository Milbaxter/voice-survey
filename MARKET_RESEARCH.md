## Key Success Factors

1. **Trust & credibility** - Swedish-speaking community is small (word-of-mouth matters)
2. **Data quality** - Accurate transcription, robust analysis (Swedish language support critical)
3. **Ease of use** - Non-technical users must be able to create surveys easily
4. **Privacy & compliance** - GDPR, Finnish data laws (healthcare data especially sensitive)
5. **Panel quality** - If building participant panel, recruitment & retention is key

---

## Risks

### High Risks
1. **Market too small** - 285K speakers = limited demand
   - *Mitigation:* Expand to other Nordic countries (Swedish speakers in Sweden, Norway)
2. **Low willingness to pay** - Organizations use free tools instead
   - *Mitigation:* Focus on managed services (higher value), build panel (hard to replicate)

### Medium Risks
3. **Competition from general platforms** - Typeform adds Swedish voice support
   - *Mitigation:* Niche positioning, personal service, deep language expertise
4. **Participant recruitment** - Hard to find engaged Swedish speakers for panel
   - *Mitigation:* Partner with Swedish cultural organizations, media

### Low Risks
5. **Technical challenges** - Voice transcription, Swedish language NLP
   - *Mitigation:* Use existing APIs (Whisper, Google Speech-to-Text support Swedish)

## Go/No-Go Framework

### GO IF:
✅ Can secure 2-3 pilot customers within first 3 months  
✅ Customers willing to pay €2,000+ for managed surveys

✅ Voice transcription quality >90% accuracy for Swedish

### NO-GO IF:
❌ Can't find pilot customers after 3 months of outreach
