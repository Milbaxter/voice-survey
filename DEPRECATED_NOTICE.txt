FILES WITH INCORRECT PRODUCT MODEL (DEPRECATED):

The following files describe "async voice surveys" (people record on their own time).
This is NOT what we're building.

ACTUAL PRODUCT: AI phone interviews (AI calls people in real-time, like CATI)

Deprecated files:
- EMAIL_DRAFT_v2_PHONE_REPLACEMENT.md
- EMAIL_DRAFT_SWEDISH.md
- READY_TO_SEND.md
- READY_TO_SEND_FINNISH.md
- READY_TO_SEND_SWEDISH.md

CURRENT FILES (CORRECT MODEL):
- SPEC.md - Product specification
- README.md - Project overview
- READY_TO_SEND_BATCH_1.md - Correct email templates
- EMAIL_TEMPLATES_CORRECTED.md - All email templates
- OUTREACH_HUB.md - Outreach command center

Created: 2026-01-29
Reason: Product model clarified - we're building AI CATI, not async surveys
