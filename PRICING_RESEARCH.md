## Pricing Psychology

### What Works:
1. **Anchor high:** Show €10,000 "traditional cost" crossed out
2. **Odd pricing:** €5,999 feels cheaper than €6,000
3. **Package naming:** "Starter/Pro/Enterprise" not "Small/Medium/Large"
4. **Money-back guarantee:** "Satisfaction guaranteed or full refund"
5. **Scarcity:** "Beta pricing ends March 1st" or "Limited to 10 pilot customers"

### Avoid:
- Hourly pricing (makes it feel like hiring a freelancer)
- "Per respondent" pricing (too granular, hard to compare)
- Too many options (decision paralysis)

## Price Justification (For Sales Calls)

**When they say:** "Why should we pay €6K when we can get transcription for €500?"

**You say:**  
> "We're not just transcription. We handle:
> - Recruiting 200 Swedish speakers in Finland (hardest part)
> - Platform for voice recording (no phone calls, no in-person)
> - AI transcription (98% accuracy, human-reviewed)
> - Data analysis and reporting
> - 2-week turnaround
>
> Compare that to hiring a market research firm at €8,500-10,000. We're 40% cheaper with better data."

---

**When they say:** "We don't have budget for this."

**You say:**  
> "What's your current process for collecting feedback from Swedish speakers? [Listen] How much does that cost in staff time? What's the opportunity cost of not hearing from 200 Swedish speakers? What decisions are you making without this data?"

---

**When they say:** "Can we start smaller?"

**You say:**  
> "Absolutely. We have a Starter package at €2,499 for 100 respondents. Or if you're not sure yet, we can do a pilot survey with 25-50 participants at cost (€500-800) just to prove the concept."
